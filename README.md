# DartArena
## Final thesis
Web-application for the game of darts with the ability to track scores and statistics
## Description
This project is the result of independet student work as part of the project assignment for the [Final thesis course](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/predmet/zavrad) at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb.

Darts is a popular board game traditionally played with a physical target and an automated scoring system. Given that many players want to accurately track their results, as well as their achievements in different types of games, there is a need for an application that would allow the game without a physical target, but with the ability to record all statistics. In this work, it is necessary to develop a web application that simulates the game of classic darts, while allowing users to enter the results of each game themselves. The application should support different types of games, such as X01, Cricket, Shanghai, Count Up and Split, and enable correct scoring depending on the type of game selected. In addition, the application should record statistical parameters such as three darts average, number of maximum scores hit (180 points), etc., and visually display them to users. All games should be created so that they can be played individually as a training session or as a duel against another user.
